//
//  On the purpose of this section:
//
//
//  Hardcoding constants is a bad coding practice and should be avoided.
//  On the other hand, numerical algorithms depend on many small tweaking parameters.
//  For example, this code computes the nodes and abscissas of Gauss-Legendre rule on the fly,
//  this is done with an iterative eigenvalue decomposition method that needs a stopping criteria,
//  we can add another user specified parameter to the corresponding "makeGlobalGrid()" rule,
//  however, this is an additional tweaking variable that the user has to understand and control.
//  The goal of our code is to provide a most seamless experience to the user,
//  one should think about the desired properties of a quadrature rule or interpolant and not
//  about convergence of an iterative scheme (especially one hidden from top view)
//  Therefore, the tolerance for such convergence criteria needs to be set inside the code to
//  a "reasonable" value, which is a value that would work well for the overwhelming majority
//  of use cases.
//
//  On the other hand, every application is different and the usage of the code will change
//  over time. It is unreasonable to believe that one single value would work for absolutely
//  everyone. Instead of "hiding" hardcoded constant throughout the code, all such constants
//  will be exposed here so the used can make adjustments in compile time.
//
//  Long story short, do not adjust those variables unless you have a good reason.
//
///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

//  NUM_TOL is used in many places:
// - as a stopping criteria for various iterative schemes (e.g., finding leja points)
// - drop criteria for eigenvalue solver related to Gauss rules
// - comparison between nodes to detect repeated points in non-nested rules (e.g., all odd Chebyshev rules include zero)
// - determining sparse matrix pattern, entries smaller than NUM_TOL will be ignored (for wavelet grids)
// - drop criteria in estimating anisotropic coefficients (refinement or just the coefficients) surpluses or Legendre coefficients below 10^3 times NUM_TOL will be ignored
#define TSG_NUM_TOL 1.E-12 // to move in hardcoded constants



// this defines the maximum number of secant method iterations to be used for finding Leja, Lebesgue, and Delta points
// this is a safeguard criteria to prevent "hanging" in a loop
#define TSG_MAX_SECANT_ITERATIONS 1000 // to move in hardcoded constants
