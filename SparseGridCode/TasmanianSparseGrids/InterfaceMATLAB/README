-   MATLAB interface for TASMANIAN Sparse Grid
-
-----------------------------------------------------------------

This is a MATLAB interface for the TASMANIAN Sparse Grid library.
The interface is NOT build on .mex files, it uses the command line wrapper tasgrid combined with text files



Requirement:

1. libtasmaniansparsegrids and tasgrid

2. Tested only on Linux, but it should work on Mac OSX



Installation:

1. Compile libtasmaniansparsegrids and tasgrid

2. Add all the tsg*.m files to your MATLAB path

3. Edit tsgGetPaths.m

   sTasGrid should be the path to the tasgrid executable

   sFiles is the folder where temporary and persistent files are to be written

   do not manually edit the files in the sFiles folder



Usage:

Every function performs one action available in tasgrid

1. For a quadrature rule, see 'help tsgMakeQuadrature'

2. For a grid with interpolation, see 'help tsgMakeGrid'

   tsgMakeGrid will create a grid file in sFiles and lGrid will contain the name of that grid
   call tsgDeleteGrid( lGrid ) before deleting lGrid, otherwise you will be left with unrefeenced files in sFiles
   you can see all grid files in sFiles by calling tsgListGridsByName()
   you can also manually delete the grids by name using tsgDeleteGridByName( 'grid_name' )
   if a grid is deleted by tsgDeleteGrid or tsgDeleteGridByName, then the files are removed and any associated lGrid should be removed
