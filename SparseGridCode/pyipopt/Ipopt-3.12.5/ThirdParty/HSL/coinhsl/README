Introduction
============
Thanks for downloading HSL software. You can find out more information about
HSL by visiting our website: http://www.hsl.rl.ac.uk/

This package is intended to be used exclusively with IPOPT. To obtain the full
version of the packages please download them from the HSL web address above.

Installation
============

You have three options for installation:
BEFORE IPOPT: Follow the instructions below. Ensure that the Ipopt configure
   script can find the resulting library.
WITH IPOPT: To compile this code at the same time as Ipopt, you will need to
   rename this directory to 'coinhsl' and place it in the ThirdParty/HSL
   subdirectory of your Ipopt source directory before configuring Ipopt.
AFTER IPOPT: For this to work, Ipopt's shared library loading functionality
   must be enabled. Compile this code using the instructions below to generate
   a shared library and place it in Ipopt's shared library search path.

Note: Using this code is not compatible with older versions of Ipopt that were
configured to build seperate HSL sources.

Compilation follows the standard process:
   ./configure
   make

To install the library, module and header files into /usr/local you may
use the following command (this may require root permissions):
   make install

To use the library, ensure that the library libcoinhsl.so can be found
by both the linker and the dynamic library loader. You can either add the
path to the ldconfig configuration, or explicitly set the environment
variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH.

For further options, including installation in locations other than
/usr/local and specifying the use of particular Fortran compilers and
compile flags please run
   ./configure --help

The file INSTALL contains more detailed information.

Other libraries
===============
To use libcoinhsl.so you MUST ensure that:
* Both HSL and IPOPT are compiled with compatible C++ and Fortran compilers,
   for example g++ and gfortran.
* A BLAS library is available. This library is usually supplied by your
   computer processor vendor (eg Intel MKL), and using a good one is critical
   to performance.
   If you are unable to locate a vendor BLAS then you should use either
   the Goto or ATLAS BLAS (the latter is often available as part of
   your linux distribution).
   Using the reference BLAS from netlib can often be ten times slower.

It is RECOMMENDED that:
* The METIS matrix ordering routines are available. This can be achieved by
   compiling them as part of IPOPT, see the IPOPT documentation for futher
   details.
* Both HSL and IPOPT are compiled using the compiler's OpenMP flags (normally
   some variant of -openmp or -fopenmp). The easiest way to do this is to
   specify at configure time ./configure CXXFLAGS=-openmp FCFLAGS=-openmp
